          <p>ICS students often spend more time than they need on their homework and donâ€™t learn the material as effectively
          as they could, because they study alone and do not leverage the power of face-to-face study groups with peer
          mentors. Collaborative Study (CS) is an application for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study
          groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic.</p>
